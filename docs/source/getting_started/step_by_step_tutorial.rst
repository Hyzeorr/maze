Maze - Step by Step
===================

This tutorial provides a step by step guide explaining how to implement your own Maze environment and
get the best out of its features.
We will do this based on the online version of the *Guillotine 2D Cutting Stock Problem*
as it is still relatively simple but exhibits the required problem structure to introduce all relevant Maze concepts.

Before diving into this tutorial we recommend to read up on the
:ref:`Maze Environment Hierarchy<env-hierarchy>`.
You can of course also do this along the way following the provided links
to explanations of the required concepts when we get there.

The remainder of this tutorial is structured as follows:
